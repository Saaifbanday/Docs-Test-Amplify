This must be on the same time scale as the Time variable. Missing values should be used for subjects who were never exposed. Each variable specified here will create a separate time-dependent covariate. A specified time assumes that a subject is not exposed prior to this time and exposed after this time (i.e. when the predictor change from &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;). Specifying only positive values means that subjects are not exposed for some time after follow-up starts. Specifying some positive and negative times indicates that some subjects were exposed after and some before follow-up time starts, respectively. If user knows that a subject was exposed prior to the follow-up start time, but user doesn't know exactly when, then user can use any negative time and the model will correctly treat that subject as being exposed for their entire follow-up time. If subjects are exposed after follow-up, then they are correctly treated as not being exposed for their entire follow-up time.</p></dd><dt id="-3pairm_38" data-expandable="false">Prefix for time-dependent covariates</dt><dd><p id="-3pairm_52">Desired prefix to be used for every time-dependent covariate specified in the Exposure time variables field.
