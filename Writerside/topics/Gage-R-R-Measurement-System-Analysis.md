# Gage R&amp;R-Measurement System Analysis

Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility (Gage R&R) is a critical tool in Measurement System Analysis (MSA) used to evaluate the accuracy and precision of a measurement system. It quantifies the amount of variability in measurements due to the measurement system itself, helping to determine whether the system is reliable enough for use in quality control or process improvement.

This method assesses the variation in measurements due to operators (appraisers) and equipment (gages). It helps distinguish between variability introduced by the measurement system and the actual variation in the process.
