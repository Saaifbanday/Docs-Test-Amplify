# Poisson

The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence, and assuming that the events occur independently of each other. It serves as a fundamental tool in statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and making predictions about future events based on past observations.

### Poisson Distribution Plot

A Poisson distribution plot visually represents the probability distribution of a discrete random variable that represents the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence.
