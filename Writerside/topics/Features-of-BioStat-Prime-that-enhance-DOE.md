# Features of BioStat Prime that enhance DOE

__Randomization:__

To remove bias and other source of extraneous variation which are not controllable, BioStat Prime randomly assigns material, people order in the experimental trails to be conducted.

__Replication:__

To increase the precision of estimate of experimental error, BioStat Prime provides repetition of basic experiment without changing factor settings.

__Blocking:__

To increase the efficiency of experimental design by decreasing experimental error, BioStat Prime breaks the experiment into homogenous segments (block) in order to control block variability.
