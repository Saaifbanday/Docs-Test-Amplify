# Process Capability

Process Capability is a statistical measure that assesses how well a process can produce products or deliver services within specified limits. It is a key concept in statistical quality control and is used to determine whether a process is capable of meeting predefined specifications. The main objective of process capability analysis is to understand the inherent variability of a process and compare it to the tolerance or specification limits.
