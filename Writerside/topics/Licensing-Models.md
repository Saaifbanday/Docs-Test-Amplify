# Licensing Models
One of the fundamental building blocks of the software is the Licensing Model that user chooses. BioStat Prime provides 4 types of licenses that user can avail, viz;

## Perpetual
A perpetual license does not expire. A perpetual license is a license that is valid forever. A perpetual license may have other rules, such as a machine activation limit, or limitations on certain features, or a lack of major version updates, etc.

## Subscription
The license status is determined by an external source of truth (like a recurring billing system). Subscriptions also have subscription periods recorded. A subscription license synchronizes the status of the subscription with the state of the license.

### Subscription Grace Period
Grace periods offer the flexibility to determine a specific timeframe, measured in hours, subsequent to the expiry of the designated validity period.

During this defined interval, the license will retain its validity, ensuring a seamless transition even after the official expiration.

## Trial

## Grouped

## Floating
A floating license, also known as a concurrent license or network license, is a software licensing model that allows a limited number of users or devices to access and use a particular software application simultaneously.

A floating license operates within a license pool that multiple users or a set number of devices can draw from as needed.

## Enterprise (Site licensing)
A site license is a type of software license that grants permission to an organization or institution to use a software product across multiple computers or devices within a specific location or site.
