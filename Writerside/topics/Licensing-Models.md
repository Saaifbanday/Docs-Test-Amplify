# Licensing Models
BioStat Prime offers four distinct licensing models, allowing users to choose the option that best fits their needs. The licensing model selected serves as a fundamental aspect of the software's usage and access.

## Perpetual
A perpetual license grants users indefinite access to the software without an expiration date. This license remains valid permanently; however, it may include specific conditions such as machine activation limits, feature restrictions, or exclusions from major version upgrades

## Subscription
This license type operates based on predefined subscription periods and continuously synchronizes the subscription status with the active state of the license.

## Grouped
BioStat Prime's grouped license allows multiple users or devices within a defined group, such as an organization or team, to access BioStat Prime under a single Admin. This model simplifies BioStat Prime's license management by enabling centralized control, ensuring that all authorized users within the group can utilize the software.

## Trial
A trial license provides users with temporary access to BioStat Prime for evaluation purposes. This allows potential users to explore the softwareâ€™s features, functionality, and capabilities before committing to a full license.

BioStat Prime's trial licenses are typically valid for a limited period. Once the trial period expires, users must upgrade to a paid license to continue accessing the software.

## Floating
A floating license, also referred to as a concurrent or network license, allows a specified number of users or devices to access BioStat Prime simultaneously.

This license operates within a shared license pool, from which authorized users or devices can dynamically obtain access as needed, ensuring efficient resource utilization across multiple users.

## Enterprise (Site licensing)
A site license grants an organization or institution the right to install and use BioStat Prime across multiple computers or devices within a designated location or site. This licensing model is ideal for institutions requiring widespread software access.
