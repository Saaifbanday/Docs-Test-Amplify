# Model Fitting

Fitting a model to data means choosing the statistical model that predicts values as close as possible to the ones observed in your population. Fitting a model to data mathematically involves finding the mathematical function or equation that best describes the relationship between the input variables (predictors) and the output variable (response) of a dataset. This process is also called regression analysis. The first step in fitting a model is choosing an appropriate mathematical function to represent the data accurately.
