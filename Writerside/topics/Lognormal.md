# Lognormal

The lognormal distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. In other words, if X follows a lognormal distribution, then Y= ln(X) follows a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The lognormal distribution is often used to model the distribution of random variables that are the product of many independent and identically distributed random variables.

To analyse it in BioStat user must follow the steps as given.

__Load the dataset -> Click on the Distribution tab in main menu -> Select Lognormal -> This leads to analysis techniques in the dialog -> In the dialog window select the options according to the requirements then execute -> The output will be represented in output window.__
