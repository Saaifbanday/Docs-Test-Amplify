# Automated ARIMA (AR)

ARIMA, which stands for Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average, is a popular time series forecasting model in statistics. It combines three components: Auto-Regressive (AR), Integrated (I), and Moving Average (MA). ARIMA models are widely used to analyze and forecast time-series data, where observations are collected at regular intervals over time. Automated ARIMA refers to the process of automatically selecting the best parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model.
