# Create DoE Factor Details

Automatically generates a table with factor details based on the parameter specified - number of factors and the maximum levels for the factors along with the default values for the factor to be used. 

>If non numeric values are used for factor, specify within single quote for example 1,-1,'name1',0,'string2'

Once the factor details are automatically generated and the factor table shows up on the data grid UI, you can change the values and/or remove some values from the grid to manipulate the table as you choose including factors with different number of values

>If the number of factors are <= 26, the factors are named with upper case alphabets as A, B, C, .., otherwise, named as F1, F2, ..., F27, F28, ..
