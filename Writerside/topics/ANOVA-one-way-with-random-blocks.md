# ANOVA, one-way with random blocks

In analysis of variance (ANOVA), the one-way ANOVA with random blocks is a variation of the traditional one-way ANOVA that incorporates the concept of random blocks. This design is often used when there is a potential source of variability in the experiment that is not of primary interest but needs to be controlled for. In the context of ANOVA, blocks refer to groups or conditions that are not of primary interest but introduce variability. These blocks are considered random because their levels are randomly selected from a larger population. The inclusion of random blocks helps to control for the potential impact of these extraneous factors.
