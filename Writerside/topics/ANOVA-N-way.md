# ANOVA, N way

In statistics, an N-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) with blocks refers to a statistical analysis that involves multiple independent variables or factors (more than two). The term "blocks" in this context refers to a way of handling potential sources of variability that are not the primary focus of the study but need to be accounted for to improve the precision of the analysis. N-way ANOVA indicates that there are multiple independent variables (factors). For example, in a 2-way ANOVA, there are two independent variables, and in an N-way ANOVA, there are more than two. Each independent variable can have multiple levels or categories. N-way ANOVA with blocks involves analyzing the effects of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable while taking into account the potential impact of blocking variables.
