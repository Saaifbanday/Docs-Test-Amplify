ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a statistical method used to analyze the differences among group means in a sample. There are two main types of ANOVA: one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA. One-Way ANOVA is used when there is one independent variable (factor) with more than two levels (groups).Two-Way ANOVA is an extension of One-Way ANOVA and is used when there are two independent variables (factors).The aov function in R is commonly used for performing ANOVA.
