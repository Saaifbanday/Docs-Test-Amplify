# Holt Winters, Non-seasonal

Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing is an extension of simple exponential smoothing that takes into account both level and trend components in a time series, and optionally, seasonality. When seasonality is not present in the data, the method is referred to as Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing without seasonality, or simply non-seasonal Holt-Winters.
