# Regression
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The primary goal of regression analysis is to understand how the independent variables contribute to the variation in the dependent variable. It is widely used in various fields, including economics, finance, biology, and social sciences.
