# Loss Function Analysis

Loss Function Analysis is a key concept in statistics, machine learning, and optimization, used to quantify the cost of errors or the difference between predicted and actual values. The purpose of a loss function is to guide a model during the training phase by minimizing the "loss" (i.e., error) so that the model can make accurate predictions.
