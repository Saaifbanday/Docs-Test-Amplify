# Cause and Effect

In Six Sigma, Cause and Effect analysis is often used to identify potential causes of a problem or defect within a process. A common tool for this analysis is the `Cause and Effect Diagram`, also known as the `Fishbone Diagram` or `Ishikawa Diagram`.

### Purpose of Cause and Effect in Six Sigma

The goal of using a Cause and Effect analysis is to systematically explore all possible causes of a problem, particularly in the `Analyze` phase of the `DMAIC` process (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control). This helps to focus on the root causes of defects, rather than symptoms.

### How Cause and Effect Diagrams Work

A typical Fishbone Diagram is structured with the main problem or effect at the head of the fish, and the potential causes branching off the spine into various categories. Each branch represents a factor that may contribute to the issue. The analysis aims to trace all root causes contributing to the observed issue.

To analyse Cause and Effect in BioStat user must follow the steps given below.
