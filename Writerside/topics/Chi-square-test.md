# Chi-square test

The chi-square test, also known as the χ² test (chi-squared test), is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant association or independence between two categorical variables in a contingency table. Chi-square statistic is calculated from the contingency table to assess the extent of the association. It measures the difference between the observed frequencies (counts) and the expected frequencies (counts) under the assumption of independence. The formula for calculating the chi-square statistic depends on the table's dimensions but generally involves comparing each observed frequency to its expected value and summing up these differences.
