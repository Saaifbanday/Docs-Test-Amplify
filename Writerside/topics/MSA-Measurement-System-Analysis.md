# MSA (Measurement System Analysis)

Measurement System Analysis (MSA) is a statistical method used to assess and ensure the reliability and accuracy of a measurement system. The goal of MSA is to identify and quantify sources of variation within a measurement process. The results of MSA can be used to improve measurement processes, reduce variability, and enhance the overall quality of data in a particular system. It is a fundamental step in ensuring the reliability of data in various applications, ultimately contributing to improved decision-making and quality control.
